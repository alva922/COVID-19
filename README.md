The coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic is the defining global health crisis of our time and the greatest challenge we have faced since World War Two. 

After over two years of living with Covid-19, we are learning to adapt to a world with this disease. 

2022 ends with looming risk of a new coronavirus variant, health experts warn.

In this repository, we explore the statistics on the coronavirus pandemic for every country in the world. The goal is to compare the latest number of confirmed deaths and recovered people of COVID-19 cases Country/Region - Province/State wise. In addition, we invoke COVID-19 Vaccine Sentiment Analysis using Twitter Data for the data science research.
